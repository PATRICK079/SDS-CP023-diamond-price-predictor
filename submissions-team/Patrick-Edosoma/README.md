# Project Scope of Works:

## Project Overview
The Diamond Price Prediction project aims to build a machine learning model that accurately estimates the price of a diamond based on its attributes such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, and dimensions. The project will involve data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment through a Streamlit web application.

## Project Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
  - Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to understand relationships between attributes.
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding for machine learning.

2. **Model Development:**
  - Engineer new features (e.g., price per carat, light reflection efficiency, etc.) to improve model accuracy.
  - Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) to predict diamond prices.
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning and evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.
  - Select the best-performing model for deployment.

3. **Model Deployment:**
  - Develop an interactive Streamlit web app where users can input diamond attributes and receive a predicted price.
  - Deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud or another hosting service.

## Workflow

### **Phase 1: Setup(1 Week)**
- Setup GitHub repo and project folders
- Setup virtual environment and respective libraries

### **Phase 2: EDA & Data Preprocessing(1 Week)**
- Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to understand relationships between attributes.
- Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding for machine learning.
- Produce visualizations which show an in-depth understanding of the data and relationships between features.

### **Phase 3: Feature Engineering & Model Development (2 Weeks)**
- Engineer new features (e.g., price per carat, light reflection efficiency, etc.) to improve model accuracy.
- Data preprocessing.
- Train and tune multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, R2.
- Select the best performing model and fine-tune the model for optimal performance.

### **Phase 4: Deployment (1 Week)**
- Develop an interactive Streamlit web app where users can input diamond attributes and receive a predicted price.
- Deploy the app on Streamlit Community Cloud or another hosting service
